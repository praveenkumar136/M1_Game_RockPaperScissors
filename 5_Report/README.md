## Introduction
The game of Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) involves two players simultaneously choosing either rock (r), paper (p), or scissors (s). Informally, the rules of the game are that “rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper”.If two players choose the same item then the round is a tie.

## Objective
The objective of Rock, Paper, Scissors is to defeat your opponent by selecting a weapon that defeats their choice under the following rules:
- Rock smashes (or blunts) Scissors, so Rock wins.


- Scissors cut Paper, so Scissors win.


- Paper covers Rock, so Paper wins.


- If players choose the same weapon, neither win and the game is played again.



## Research
The earliest form of Rock Paper Scissors was created in Japan and is called Janken.  This is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century. Janken uses the Rock, Paper and Scissors signs. It is the game that the modern version of Rock Paper Scissors derives from directly. Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th Century.
